<https://gitlab.com/brlin/framework-laptop-delete-key-defect-workaround>

## Usage

Refer to the following instructions on how to workaround this defect under Linux:

1. [Install keyd](https://github.com/rvaiya/keyd?tab=readme-ov-file#installation), pre-built packages are available for many Linux distributions.
1. Install [the workaround-faulty-framework-laptop-delete-key.conf keyd configuration file](workaround-faulty-framework-laptop-delete-key.conf) to /etc/keyd _as root_.
1. Ensure the keyd daemon is running by running the following command _as root_:

    ```bash
    systemctl start keyd
    ```

1. Run the following command _as root_ to reload the configuration file if the keyd daemon is already running:

    ```bash
    keyd reload
    ```

   for Debian-based distribution the keyd command is renamed as `keyd.rvaiya` so run the following command instead:

    ```bash
    keyd.rvaiya reload
    ```

1. Done!  Now when you presses the Shift+Backspace key combination it will function as the alternative Delete key!
